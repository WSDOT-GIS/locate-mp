This is the repository for the WSDOT Milepost map, an interactive map application for locating Mileposts along Washington's State Routes. See this [story map] for an introduction to the WSDOT <abbrev title='Linear Referencing System'>LRS</abbrev>.

Recommended development environment is [Visual Studio Code] or [VSCodium]

Uses [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript] for map components.

- [ ] Code that is not specific to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript] is in the `src/common` workspace. Keeping it separate will make it easier to switch to a different mapping library if that becomes necessary.

## ðŸš§ Work in progress: copy local assets

This branch is an attempt to implement working with a local copy of the @arcgis/core assets, as described [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/#managing-assets-locally).

### Issues

- CSS, etc., works correctly, but in the production build (but not dev), the app cannot find files related to Web Workers.
